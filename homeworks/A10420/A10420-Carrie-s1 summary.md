I really appreciate ShuShu's coding class. It's like he's bringing a torch of enlightment to all of us "coding cavemen".

My girlfriend who is the organizer of "R Girl" in Taiwan is doing almost the samething. We all belive girls can do coding as well as boys. Just, who is the first person to devote in  girls' education? 

Anyway, thanks a lot. Hope I can join in this class next time.
